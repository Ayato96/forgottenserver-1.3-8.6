### Issues

We use the [issue tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/nekiro/forgottenserver-1.3-8.6/issues). Keep in mind that everyone who is watching the repository gets notified by e-mail when there is activity, so be thoughtful and avoid writing comments that aren't meaningful for an issue (e.g. "+1"). If you'd like for an issue to be fixed faster, you should either fix it yourself and submit a pull request, or place a bounty on the issue.

### Note from me (Nekiro)

Pull requests are always welcome, if you feel like you can make this repository better, don't think twice, submit a pull request. I will happily review it!
Also one last note, please use english everywhere, in issues, pull requests even in the code, so we don't have problems with understanding ourselves.
